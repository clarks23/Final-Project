# Introduction to GitHub

In this section, we'll cover the basics of GitHub and why it's a powerful tool for version control and collaboration.

## What is GitHub?

GitHub is a web-based platform that uses Git for version control. It allows you to track changes in your code, collaborate with others, and manage your projects effectively.

## Key Concepts

### Repositories

A repository, or "repo," is a container for your project. It contains all the files, including the revision history.

### Commits

A commit is a snapshot of your project at a specific point in time. It represents changes made to your code.

### Branching

Branching allows you to create a separate line of development. It's useful for working on new features or bug fixes without affecting the main project.

## Getting Started

To start using GitHub, you'll need to:

1. Create a GitHub account.
2. Set up Git on your local machine.
3. Create a new repository on GitHub.
4. Clone the repository to your local machine.
