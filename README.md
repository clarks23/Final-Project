### 8. How to Code Your Repository(With Markdown)

- Locate the File:

- Find the file you want to edit within the repository. It could be the README.md or any other Markdown file.
Click on the Edit Button:

On the file's page, click the "Edit" button. This typically looks like a pencil icon and is located near the top-right corner of the file view.
Edit in the GitHub Web Editor:

GitHub will open the file in its web-based editor. This editor allows you to make changes directly in the browser.
Write Markdown Code:

In the editor, you can start writing your Markdown code directly. Use Markdown syntax for formatting, such as # for headers, - or * for lists, and so on.
Preview Your Changes:

To preview how your Markdown will look, click on the "Preview changes" tab. This allows you to see the rendered Markdown before committing the changes.
Commit Your Changes:

After you are satisfied with your changes, scroll down to the bottom of the page. Provide a commit message summarizing your edits.
Commit Changes:

Click the "Commit changes" button to save your edits.
Verify Your Changes:

GitHub will automatically update the file in your repository with your new Markdown content. You can go back to the main repository page to see the changes.
Done!

### You've successfully written and committed Markdown code directly on GitHub using the web editor.
